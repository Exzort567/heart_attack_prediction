This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical parameters. The prediction model is built using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).
